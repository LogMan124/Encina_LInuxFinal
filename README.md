## **Description**
This is a project final for CIS20231N2 Linux. It contains a README.MD, and Bash.txt/.sh file.
In experimenting with Bash I have developed a beutiful script and am ready to document my process.

<a name="File-Contents"></a>
### **Contents In .sh/.txt File** 
[^1]
1. Welcome sign
2. A loop from 1-50
3. Ending sign
- **The Beginning**
The code used in the beginning is colors for the fonts, the fonts where brought to us by figlet. 
I used the colors and the Fonts to build the beginning sign, color and font the printed numbers, and build the Ending sign.
- **The Middle**
In the middle we have our loop from 1 to 50, I used the sleep, and echo command to print the numbers and figlet helped with the font and echo also helped with the colors
- **The End**
In the end I added a ending sign using figlet and the font color, at the very end I used the sleep command to wait 5 seconds and the clear command to cleanup the job.

[^1]: Throughout the code I added a black background, just thought it would be fun.

## Aquiring git repository and running code
**$ git clone https://git@github.com:LogMan124/Encina_LInuxfinal.git**
-Then use git Archive
**$ git archive**
-That should pull the files and now you should just execute the .sh file
**$ ./sh**

I hope you enjoy.
