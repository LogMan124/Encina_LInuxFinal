# Encina_LinuxFinal
# Description
This is a project final for CIS20231N2 Linux. It contains a README.MD, and Bash.txt/.sh file.
In experimenting with Bash I have developed a beutiful script and am ready to document my process.

It contains a Welcome Sign, a loop from 1-50, and a Ending sign
The code used in the beginning is colors for the fonts, the fonts where brought to us by figlet. 
I used the colors and the Fonts to build the beginning sign, color and font the printed numbers, and build the Ending sign.
In the middle we have our loop from 1 to 50, I used the sleep, and echo command to print the numbers and figlet helped with the font and echo also helped with the colors
In the end I added a ending sign using figlet and the font color, at the very end I used the sleep command to wait 5 seconds and the clear command to cleanup the job.
Thtoughout the code I added a black background, just thought it would be fun.

I hope you enjoy.
